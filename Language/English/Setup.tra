@57=~The Standard Model of The Planes~
@59=~The multiverse you stand in is complex beast, most sages give the model of a wheel or onion, and a common description is as follows

"Since they are without form or dimension, it is not possible to draw a road-map of the
planes and their relationships to each other. However, there is a structure and organization to them which can best be visualized as a series of spheres, one inside the other.

The Prime Material Planes
At the very center of this series of spheres are the Prime Material planes. These are the planes most familiar to Greyhawk creatures. The prime material planes include the many Earth-like alternate worlds and campaigns that operate from the more or less the same basic realities. There may be variations from prime to prime, but most features remain the same. The inhabitants of each prime always refer to their plane as the Prime Material Plane.

The Ethereal Planes
Surrounding each Prime Material plane is a separate Ethereal plane. The Ethereal planes are misty realms of proto-matter. Nothing is solid on these planes. In the Ethereal planes, there may be small pockets or islands of matter known as demiplanes. These demi-planes are sometimes the creations of extremely powerful wizards, technologists, or demi-gods.

The Inner Planes
Using the sphere analogy, outside of the Primes and the Ethereal planes are the inner planes, the primary building forces of the multiverse. The inner planes consist of the elemental, para-elemental, and quasi-elemental planes, and the planes of energy. The elemental planes are the building blocks of matter Air, Water, Fire, and Earth. Where the elemental planes touch each other there arise the para-elemental planes Smoke, Ice, Ooze, and Magma. The Energy planes are the Positive Energy plane (also called the Plane of Life) and the Negative Energy plane (the source of entropy). The quasi elemental planes exist where the elemental planes touch the Energy planes Lightning, Steam, Minerals, and Radiance around the Positive Energy plane, and Salt, Vacuum, Ash, and Dust around the Negative Energy plane. Many of the planes have their own creatures and rulers who are sometimes summoned to one of the primes through spells or magical items.

The Astral Plane
Beyond the inner planes (continuing with the spheres) is the Astral plane. Like the Ethereal planes, this plane serves as a connector between the different realities. It links the various Primes to each other (one travels from one Prime to another by crossing the Astral plane, not the Ethereal) and connects each Prime to the outer planes. The Astral plane is a barren place with only rare bits of solid matter. Indeed, the most common feature is the silver cords of travelers in the plane. These cords are the lifelines that keep travelers of the Plane from becoming lost, stretching all the way back to the traveler's point of origin.

The Outer Planes
Finally, outside all else are the Outer Planes, also called the Planes of Power. There are 17 known Outer Planes there may be more. These planes can be reached only by powerful spells or by crossing the Astral plane. Each outer plane is unique. Some seem quite similar to the primes; others have terrain and physical laws wildly different from that to which the characters may be accustomed. Magic functions differently on each plane as do many other common assumptions of reality. Powerful beings (self-proclaimed gods, goddesses, and demi-gods) inhabit these planes along with a full range of other life forms. The outer planes are the final resting place of the spirits of intelligent life forms of the Prime Material planes. The known outer planes have been named by humans. Some of these names are:

Mechanus
Arcadia
Mount Celestia
Bytopia
Elysium
Beast lands
Olympus
Ysgard
Limbo
Pandemonium
The Abyss
Carceri
Gray Waste
Gehenna
Baator
Acheron
The Outlands"

@62=~Most of this strange looking book written on strange looking parchment is in some indecipherable script that refuses to be understood despite the best magics you have. Throughout the tome though there are several hand written notes penned in ancient Drow which have obviously been added recently
After some effort you translate some of the notes

@63=~An Alliance of Dark Powers~
@64=~The Secret Pact~
@65=~Well met child of Bhal I address you directly for it has come to my attention that a new and terrible threat has emerged to plague the many planes.
There has been made a secret alliance of dark gods and powers, headed by Lolth herself.
This is not a new thing, often various gods both light and dark have worked together for some common goal but this is different and worrying in two ways.
First the alliance is composed of many who had previously been at war, namely Orcus and Balrog who hate one another, to unify such long time opponents there must be such a prize for both that should make the forces of good and light very very worried.
Second the alliance obviously has some purpose, since I have been aware of this alliance Lolth , Balrog, Orcus and many other dark minions have been seen in all parts of the multiverse collecting rare minerals, magics and lore.

Both these things alone would suggest we should investigate further, together they spell real trouble.

What works in our favor is the dark powers inability to hold a secret, already I have discovered that they seek to create a base of operations in a pocket plane made from astral debris, apparently they had hoped to obtain a astral shard to hide the location but that plan was recently foiled, anyway it would take an astral map to find the place and they most certainly would hide that well!!!!

And then there is that damn prophesy, from the mad Arab, I am sure the two events are linked. So I send you this word child of Bhall, weather you are currently on the side of righteousness or not, you should investigate and play your part in this, I have played my part by bringing you this word, you must do the same and prevent the end Azir has foreseen. For if the end of the gods comes to pass, so will your doom come to pass since the blood of a god flows within you too!

@295=~Advanced studies of the nature of the planes...The Ethreal Plane~
@297=~The Ethereal plane is a plane of swirling proto-matter coexisting alongside Prime Material plane touching the Prime at all points. The Ethereal is the cosmic "glue" that binds together the Prime Material and inner planes.lt also contains the stuff that new demi planes are made of. It is a roiling, chaotic plane filled with swirling fogs and shadowy shapes in various degrees of solidity Travelers and the few natives that exist in this plane appear semi*solid as well and nonliving objects can pass through each other easily.
The first-time visitor deep within the plane may find himself completely surrounded by colorful mists, or in areas that resemble small towns on misty, fog-bound evenings. There is gravity in the sense of an up and a down direction, but the ethereal visitor can move in all directions freely. Visitors and other objects are supported by the ethereal medium, so that unsupported objects do not fall in Ethereal plane, despite the existence of a down direction. The traveler in the Ethereal consists of the same base material and therefore has the same density as his surroundings. A traveler can move forward, backward, up, or down by parting the vaporous medium at will.
The Ethereal is unique among the planes in that a visitor can exist simultaneously in both the Ethereal and another plane, in a region of the Ethereal plane known as the Border Ethereal. The Border Ethereal is explained below and is considered part of the Ethereal plane (the "edge" of the infinite plane)  the non-Border parts of the Ethereal are referred to as the Deep Ethereal.
The Ethereal can be thought of as a great ocean, so that a traveler can wade along the beach (in the Border Ethereal), alongside familiar lands, or journey across the E:thereal ocean (the Deep Ethereal) into new lands.
The Ethereal plane is used as a means of travel from the Prime To the inner planes which include the elemental para elemental and quasi-elemental planes, as well as the Positive and Negative
Material planes. The Ethereal also provides access to the demiplanes
A traveler becoming ethereal slowly disappears from view, taking a round to fade away, whether entering the Deep Ethereal or the Border Ethereal. The ethereal traveler is invisible for as long he remains in the Ethereal plane; when he leaves the Ethereal plane, he rematerializes in one round in the next plane on his itinerary. A traveler returning from the Ethereal plane can take actions and attack others in the Prime plane, but cannot disappear again into the
Ethereal until the following round. The most common example of this are creatures with phasing abilities such as phase spiders. They reappear and deliver their deadly bites in one round but require the next round to return to their invisible and ethereal state
The Ethereal plane is accessible at every point of the Prime Material plane it touches, so there are no free standing ducts, gates, or portals. Rather, the entire Prime is bordered by the
Ethereal; those who walk along this border can interact with creatures on the Prime plane.
To use the analogy of the Ethereal as an ocean, a person in the Border Ethereal is standing in the surf of that ocean where it meets the shore. He can see what is happening on the shore, and he can move along the shore, but he is still in the water. Thus a traveler standing in the Border Ethereal can see into the Prime plane, but he is still an ethereal being.
Subjective time flows for the traveler in the Border Ethereal as for the plane he is viewing. In the Border Ethereal with the Prime Material and outer planes, subjective time flows at the same rate as true time.
An individual in the Border Ethereal is invisible to those in the bordering plane, although he can be detected from that plane by means of the detect etherealness or detect invisible spells. Such a traveler revealed would appear as a smoky, translucent shade.
Travelers in the Border Ethereal are visible to others in the Border Ethereal. Individuals in the Border Ethereal cannot verbally communicate with inhabitants of the plane they border, nor can they use equipment items or spells to attack individuals in the plane they border. Likewise, inhabitants of the other plane cannot attack beings that are in the Border Ethereal. Certain spells, such as phase door and dispel magic, can bring the beings out of the Border Ethereal
and into the other plane. Border Ethereal creatures can attack each other, and they can
be attacked by creatures that have attacks capable of reaching into the Ethereal plane.
Travelers in the Border Ethereal can move through the plane They are bordering without problem moving vertically or horizontally at will without need for support. They travel at the speed they would move on that plane given their usual movement abilities
The traveler in the Border Ethereal can move through solid matter in the plane he borders without ill effects in most cases. Stone can be breached without creating an opening, and the
ethereal traveler can pass through a wall of fire or volcano unscathed, provided it is on the other plane. Damage that extends into the Ethereal plane does affect the ethereal traveler. The dangers of invisible individuals walking through walls via the Border Ethereal have not been lost on the powers that live in the planes adjacent to it. Three things in the plane bordering the
Ethereal hinder movement in the Ethereal: certain spells that detect and ban the ethereal dense metals, and living beings. Spells that affect movement and creatures in the Ethereal plane. include glyph of warding and Mordenkainen's faithful hound, which both detect and attack ethereal creatures. Of a more permanent nature is an alchemic mixture containing gorgon's blood that, when mixed with the mortar of a building, prevents ethereal and astral
creatures from passing through the walls. This last potion usually costs 10,000 gp from a reputable alchemist.
Dense metals also prevent passage by those in the Border Ethereal, so a large collection of gold or plates of lead can be used to ethereal-proof an area. Any metal denser than gold can
be used, though this is often an expensive proposition. This method also allows dwarven and human miners to discover new veins of dense ore by sending scouts in the Border Ethereal
through the surface. The type of material found cannot be determined in this fashion, however, and unlucky miners may dig up an ancient, sealed tomb of a fell power.
Living beings (at least those above the one-celled level)generate an aura that prevents passage by ethereal beings. Thus a guard outside the door of a room whose walls were built with gorgon's blood in the mortar prevents ethereal passage. This aura radiates about a foot in all directions, so that it is possible to pass under or over living guards. Because of this aura, a traveler cannot materialize partially inside the body of an opponent or leave a weapon where it will rematerialize into a living creature. Plants also radiate this aura, so a vine-covered cottage is also immune to ethereal visitors.
A traveler in the Border Ethereal sometimes may be forced to regain his physical form inside an existing object. (This usually occurs because the spell 'or potion has expired or a dispel magic has been cast upon the traveler.) Liquids, gases, and flames part to allow the traveler entrance, but solid objects resist such intrusions. A traveler reappearing inside a solid object must roll a saving throw vs. death magic. Failing that save results in the physical destruction of the traveler; success plunges the traveler into the Deep Ethereal where he is unconscious for 1d4truerounds. Several travelers reappearing together are sent to different areas of the plane. Those who survive the trauma remain ethereal until they choose to enter another Border Ethereal, at which point they become non-ethereal and emerge into the plane they have chosen 
The plane adjoining the Border Ethereal is visible to the ethereal traveler, but neither clearly nor to great depth. All colors are reduced to shades of grey, so that dark green and dark blue are identical blacks, while tomato red is grey and bright yellows white. Furthermore, sight into the plane adjoining the Border Ethereal is limited to 12" in daylight, and may be further limited
by available light in that plane. A traveler with infravision be able to see normally but someone with an ethereal light source would not (the light from an ethereal lantern does not reflect off non-ethereal objects and thus it does not illuminate objects in the other plane).
Spells in the Border Ethereal work under the restrictions for the entire Ethereal plane as far as affecting other ethereal creatures. No spells cast on the Border Ethereal can affect the plane that it adjoins, with the exception of certain divination magics.
While the traveler in the Border Ethereal faces a number of problems in this region of the plane, he is free of the greatest danger of the Ethereal: the ether cyclone.
The traveler may choose to leave the border region of the Ethereal plane for the depths of the plane itself. This may be desirable to escape pursuit or a powerful foe, or to reach the inner planes and demi-planes. A traveler can only reach the plane that he is now bordering. A traveler desiring to venture deeper into the Ethereal merely wills it so. An individual who witnesses this processes the traveler stepping back into a roiling mist which then closes In on itself. ~

@298=~Advanced studies of the nature of the planes...The Inner Planes ~
@300=~The inner planes, also called the elemental planes, are planes consisting primarily of one type of matter. The inner planes consist of six major planes and 12 minor planes, arranged on a sphere The Prime Material planes and Ethereal plane are located Inside that sphere. The following are the six major elemental planes:

The plane of elemental Fire
The plane of elemental Earth
The plane of elemental Air
The plane of elemental Water
The plane of Positive Energy (Positive Material plane)
The plane of Negative Energy (Negative Material plane)

The twelve minor planes are divided into two types: The paraelemental planes, which exist between the four elemental planes and the quasi-elemental planes, which exist between the elemental and Positive or Negative Material planes.
The para-elemental planes and quasi-elemental planes are as follows:

The plane of para-elemental Smoke between the planes of Fire and Air
The plane of para-elemental Ice between the planes of Air and Water
The plane of para-elemental Ooze between the planes of Water and Earth
The plane of para-elemental Magma between the planes of Earth and Fire
The plane of quasi-elemental Lightning between the planes of Positive Energy and Air
The plane of quasi-elemental Steam between the planes of Positive Energy and Water
The plane of quasi-elemental Radiance between the planes of Positive Energy and Fire
The plane of quasi-elemental Minerals between the planes of Positive Energy and Earth
The plane of quasi-elemental Vacuum between the planes of Negative Energy and Air
The plane of quasi-elemental Salt between the planes of Negative Energy and Water
The plane of quasi-elemental Ash between the planes of Negative Energy and Fire
The plane of quasi-elemental Dust between the planes of Negative Energy and Earth

Each elemental plane has a solid core of its elemental type for example, pure rock in the case of elemental Earth. Each also contains islands of other elemental material that allow a wide
variety of creatures to survive in that plane .These elemental, para-elemental, quasi-elemental and Positive and Negative Material planes share a inborn hostility to life forms not from the inner planes, and to life from the Prime Material plane in particular. Travelers. are therefore warned to wander here only if they possess specific protection, or, lacking that protection, remain in the Border Ethereal of these planes. ~

@301=~Advanced studies of the nature of the planes...The Astral Plane ~
@303=~The Astral plane consists of a inter-dimensional nothingness, a barren expanse extending in all directions. The only breaks in this bleakness are small islands of matter broken off from their native dimensions and occasional wide, spinning columns of Astral conduits and wormholes .Wormholes interconnect the outer planes with each other and with the Prime Material plane. The Astral is little more than a plane of transit, a means of moving between the inner and outer planes, It is also secondarily a home for extra-planar creatures. The plane has precious few native creatures, and the only Power that makes his home here  is Anubis of the Egyptian mythos.
A traveler finding himself in the Astral sees a bright, well-lit grayness that extends in all directions, as if he is within a thick silver atmosphere, The Astral material is very clear, and vision is unimpaired up to its physical limits. The plane is incredibly grey and dull save for color pools, other travelers, and conduits to other planes. Pools are readily accessable portals into the other planes of existence. Other travelers are natives of other planes who have found a way to enter the Astral. Conduits resemble water spouts on a stormy day at sea, their ends lost in vast expanses of grey at either end. Wormholes are inter dimensional vortices that link the outer planes with the Prime Material planes in much the same way as the elemental vortices link the Prime Material planes with the inner planes. In this case, however the conduit exists through a third plane, the Astral.
The Astral plane has no gravity, though objects retain their masses here and can be thrown at normal velocities. This is different from the neutrally buoyant Ethereal planes and the self determined gravity of the inner planes. This weightlessness requires some acclimation, and there may be difficulty in performing some actions until that acclimation is made. Beings can move by pushing off large objects, but most usually move by concentrating on where they want to go.
The Astral plane can be reached from almost any point in the Prime Malarial plane and most points in the first (closest) layers of the outer planes. Entering these planes is normally done through color pools that open onto particular areas of the destination plane. Unlike the situation in the Ethereal, a being's living form can exist only in the Astral or the other plane it cannot exist in both simultaneously. 
The Astral plane cannot be reached from any of the inner planes. It can be reached from the Ethereal plane only through ether cyclones, which create temporary ruptures between the Astral and Ethereal
The Astral plane and those powerful realms that lie beyond it are generally reached by two very different means. The traveler can reach this plane either by projecting his astral form into the plane or by physically entering the plane. Either method can be accomplished by spell, psionic ability, or device, and each has similarities, advantages, and disadvantages

Reaching the Astral by Projection
Projecting one's astral form is the healthiest method of traveling to the Astral plane. This method using the astral spell separates the astral self from the traveler's body. The astral self bound to its original body by a silver cord can then enter the Astral plane and travel through it to the outer planes. Travel by this fashion has a great advantages in that the traveler does not risk his real hide-if the astral form is slain or destroyed, the traveler's psyche returns to his original body. Further, the traveler can voluntarily return to his original body if there is a horrendous danger or hazardous situation to confront. This return takes 10 melee rounds, but it can be delayed by the forces of a psychic wind.
The astral form appears on the Astral plane as a translucent, white, humanoid form. This form is solid and treated in most situations in the astral as a physical body. Springing from the back 0f this astral form is a silver cord that connects the traveler with his physical body on the Prime Material plane. This cord is visible as a translucent while string that stretches back about 100 feet and then becomes both invisible and intangible. The silver cord can be stretched to any length but it is not truly solid in the same fashion as the astral body, and as such cannot be attacked or broken except under special circumstances.
An individual's astral form includes the traveler's body and the astral forms of any magical items. All other items are
left behind. Those wishing to bring along sufficient equipment for adventures beyond the plane, or at least sufficient clothing are advised that an enchantment or alteration spell placed upon these items is recommended to insure safe and modest travel.
Objects that the astrally projecting traveler  finds in the Astral can be brought into the Prime Malerial or outer planes, provided they do not exceed the traveler's normal encumbrance limits. A projecting traveler cannot bring a castle out of the Astral plane, But he can return to his physical body with a chest of gold.
The disadvantages of astral projection are several. The first is the care of the physical body. A physical body without its astral Component does not age nor does it require food water or air. 
He appears to be in a state of suspended animation that resembles a Hold monster spell. The body can be physically moved while the astral form is absent; the astral form will return to its body wherever it  has been moved, Provided it remains on a plane accessible from the Astral (an astral form cannot rejoin its body if that body is placed in the Ethereal for example). The physical body is subject to normal damage, which the astral form is not aware of at the time the damage is inflicted. If the physical body is slain, the silver cord disappears and the character dies.
Another danger of projecting the astral form is possession. A great many extradimensional creatures  can enter the Prime Material plane by possessing the body of a traveler whose astral form is out to lunch.

Physical Travel in the Astral Plane
The traveler using most plane-spanning devices, as well as the spell plane shift, can bring his body into the Astral and make his way about in that plane. Creatures and objects blown into this plane from the Ethereal by an ether cyclone lose their ethereal status and are treated as physically traveling through this plane. The advantage of this is that all possessions are brought along, regardless of magical status and that there is no silver Cord to threaten the traveler's safety. The disadvantage of this method of travel is that the traveler's body can be damaged and slain normally.
In the Astral plane using this form of entry, the physical body appears normally, in its natural colors. The physical body has no silver cord. Both astral forms and physical bodies have equal substance, and a physical body can pick up an astral object or combat an astral foe.
Because the physical form in the Astral plane has no silver cord, the physical astral traveler must find a color pool to his home plane and use it to get back home or cast a second planeshift spell.
Color Pools
The gateways to the myriad alternate Prime Material planes and the first layers of the outer planes appear as two-dimensional pools of rippling colors. These range in size from 10-60 feet in diameter. They are visible from only one side, so that a traveler approaching from the "blind side" can pass through a pool without realizing it.
Travelers who enter the Astral always find themselves near a pool of silvery color. In the case of those projecting into the Astral, their silver cords lead back into that pool. Silver pools that ripple like mercury in a pan always lead to the plane the traveler projected from. The gateways to other planes can be identified by color, as follows:

1 Concordant Opposition.....Leather Brown
2 Happy Hunting Grounds.....Emerald (Faceted Green)
3 Olympus...................Sapphire (Faceted Blue)
4 Gladsheim.................Indigo
5 Limbo.....................Jet (Reflective Black)
6 Pandemonium...............Magenta
7 Abyss.....................Amethyst
8 Tarterus..................Olive
9 Hades.....................Rust
10 Gehenna..................Russet
11 Nine Hells...............Ruby
12 Acheron..................Flame (Bright Orange )
13 Nirvana..................Red
14 Arcadia..................Diamond (Faceted Blue)
15 Seven Heavens............Saffron
16 Twin Paradises...........Gold
17 Elysium..................Opal Amber
18 Prime Material...........Silver
19 Other Prime Material.....Other Metallic Colors
20 Ethereal.................Spiraling White


Portals to one's own Prime Material plane are always silvier. Those to alternate Prime Material planes are other metallic colors, such as bronze, gunmetal, tarnished sillier, or brass. The same is true for creatures of alternate Prime Material planes: their home portals appear silver and those of others are other metallic shades.
The portals to the Ethereal look like milky water flowing in a spiral pattern. What the astral traveler is seeing is the end point of an ether al cyclone, where it disrupts the barrier between the Ethereal and Astral planes. Individuals passing from the Ethereal to the Astral are treated as physical-form travelers (they lose their ethereal nature). Travelling from the Astral to the Ethereal in physical form endows the travelers with etherealness. Traveling from the Astral to the Ethereal in astral form results in the creation of an ethereal body in a similar fashion to creation of a body in the outer planes. The ethereal-astral form cannot reenter the Prime Material plane in which the original body resides. In either case, the traveler from the Astral to the Ethereal finds himself in the middle of the ether cyclone, with all resultant effects and penalties (including sudden and violent expulsion back into the Astral or other plane of existence)~

@304=~Advanced studies of the nature of the planes...Outer plane Landmarks The river Styx ~
@306=~The river Styx is a permanent conduit through the lower planes, from the battlefields of Acheron through the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Tarterus, the Abyss, and Pandemonium. It functions in much the same way as the Yggdrasil as a method of transportation through these planes Contrary to speculation the Styx does not extend into the Astral plane, though portals do stand on the banks of the river, enabling the boatmen of that fell river to reach the Astral plane.
The Styx is always in motion as it flows through the top layers of each of the seven lower planes. The fifth level of the Nine Hells, which contains the world-ocean Stygia, is connected to the Styx, as are a number of the deeper layers of the Abyss. The Styx does not appear to have a origin oradinal outflow, nor does it move linearly to adjacent planes. Boatmen have been able to pass from Acheron to the Abyss in a matter of hours, without passing through the planes between them. 
The tangled skein that is the full flow of the Styx has not been measured. Perhaps it cannot be measured, seeing as it is an infinitely long river that passes through a number of infinite planes.
Those who touch, drink, or are immersed in the Styx forget Their entire past life including spells and all alignments save their original one. ~

@307=~Advanced studies of the nature of the planes...Outer plane Landmarks... The river Oceanus ~
@309=~The River Oceanus
The river Oceanus links the planes of Elysium, Happy Hunting Grounds, and Olympus in much the same way that the Styx links the lower planes. Like the Styx, the Oceanus disappears and reappears a number of times in different layers of the planes, but it seems to follow a course that begins in Thalasia, the third layer of Elysium, flows through the second and first layers of that plane, then across the topmost layer of the Happy Hunting Grounds, then into the topmost layer of Olympus to its final rest in the second layer of that plane, which is called Ossa.
The Oceanus is a more natural river than the Styx, and no harm comes to those who drink of it. The Oceanus, however, does pose all the normal dangers of a large river, and does not have the supernatural boatmen of the lifeblood of the lower planes, the Styx.~

@310=~Advanced studies of the nature of the planes...Nirvana ~
@312=~Nirvana
Nirvana is the plane of ultimate Law, a perfectly regimented order.
It consists of equal measures of light and dark equal proportions of Heat and cold and equal parts of the four elements. All matter has its place and knows its place in the plane of Nirvana. Nirvana contains no passion, illusion, or pain. Individual consciousness exists only to perfect order. When all consciousnesses are completely subsumed into the whole, the society achieves perfection.
Nirvana is a single infinite plane with planar layers that extend in all directions, without true floor or ceiling. The void is filled, however, with huge interlocking wheels, like the internal cogs 0f an ornately carved clock. These wheels are great platters of matter, however, each 500 miles or more in radius. The plane is filled with an infinite number of these clockwork disks, interlocking along their edges so that the slow revolution of one disk is picked up by adjacent disks and transferred to others so the entire plane spins in unison.
Each circular realm has its own gravity, so disks can meet at right angles without disturbing the inhabitants of either one. This gravity extends in a sphere above and below each disk, though usually only one side of a disk is inhabited. Those beyond the bounds of any disk's gravity float as in the Astral plane, but there is a subtle tug from nearby realms, so a traveler suspended in space eventually falls within the pull of a.. The space between the disks is air so flying is possible between the realm-disks.
Free-standing portals to the Prime Material plane usually exist in the center of a realm's inhabited ("topmost") side. These usually lead to planes where the realm's Powers are worshiped, or at least acknowledged. There is no equivalent of the Yggdrasil or Styx in the plane of Nirvana. However, if the Greater Babylonian Power Anu must leave his realm, a temporary conduit known as "Anu's Way" (a red carpet, in effect), bridges Nirvana and the Prime Material through the Astral while Anu is gone. On these occasions, Mardukis summoned from Arcadia to mind Anu's realm. ~

@313=~Advanced studies of the nature of the planes...Twin Paradises ~
@315=~Twin Paradises
The Twin Paradises are the homes of those spirits and powers that believe in the forces of good. They believe in organization only when necessary or when it is the best method of dealing with a problem. This plane is unique among the outer planes in that the barrier between the two is large, encompassing the upper regions of both layers, and very transparent, so that the surface of one layer can be viewed from the other as a ghostly mirror reflection against the sky.
The best analogy to the Twin Paradises is a book with no spine. The insides of the two covers are the surfaces of the two layers (facing each other). A traveler standing in one of the layers can look up and see the other layer hanging high overhead (and upside down, according to the traveler's perspective). Gravity functions normally for each layer (each looks look upside down to the other). The two layers are separated by a wide gulf of air (the separation is 20 miles from sea level to sea level). The barrier between the planar layers is in midair, halfway between the layers. A traveler can fly up to the barrier, make the necessary Wisdom Check for crossing the barrier, and then fly down into the other layer. Travelers seeking a more discreet method of traveling between the barriers can climb one of several tall mountains that reach the barrier and connect to a mountain that reaches up from the other layer. Climbing a peak and crossing the barrier without preparation for the reversed direction in gravity can be hazardous, even fatal.
Each layer gives off a golden-white glow that provides the illumination for this plane. These facing layers of the Paradises are named Shurrockand Dothion. Dothion is usually considered the topmost plane,(nearest the Astral). Portals to the other planes from either layer appear as caverns with patterns shining within. Those with concentric
circle patterns lead to the Seven Heavens, those with radiating lines lead to Elysium, and those with spiderweb patterns lead to Concordant Opposition. ~

@316=~Advanced studies of the nature of the planes...Elysium ~
@318=~Elysium
Elysium is the plane of ultimate good, unsullied by the concerns of hierarchy or anarchy. The spirits that reside here cannot be summoned or controlled, for they are at final rest. The Powers of the plane answer only those callings that they deem worthy (or profitable).
The four layers of Elysium are dominated by the River Oceanus, which begins in the fourth (outermost) layer of this plane and flows down to the innermost layer (the layer nearest the Astral). From there Oceanus meanders into the Happy Hunting Grounds and then into the innermost layer of Olympus. These three good planes are linked by the Oceanus in the same manner as the lower planes are linked by the river Styx. The chief difference is that the Oceanus is a slow, peaceful flow, navigable by mere mortals (though its peaceful flow is often broken by rapids, Cascades,waterialls, and occasional fallen trees). The river separates and recombines many times in its passage, So travelers often find themselves journeying down side channels that soon rejoin the main stream. There are no equivalents to Charon or charona daemons for the Oceanus, but there are also no hydrodaemons to threaten travelers. There are other creatures that live in the Oceanus, including nymphs similar to those in the Prime planes. There are the standard chances for boats to capsize and Travelers to drown in the Oceanus, though this flow lacks the dangers of the Lethe or Styx.
The lands of Elysium are fertile along the banks of the Oceanus, filled with pines and sweet-smelling flowering trees. Farther from the banks, the vegetation becomes smaller but no Jessrich, until rolling grasslands are reached some hundreds of miles from the river. These grasslands eventually give way to arid rock formations of startling beauty carved by wind or the hand of some artistic Power. Most of the realms are found along the banks of the Oceanus, though there are great Powers who make their homes far from the crowd.~

@319=~Advanced studies of the nature of the planes... Happy Hunting Grounds ~
@321=~Happy Hunting Grounds
The Happy Hunting Grounds, also known as the Beastlands, is a triple-layered plane of good tending toward chaos. It is a densely forested plane in all its layers, though its forests vary from giant cycads to pines to sequoias to oaks to beeches to birches and to more alien reaches of huge expanses of hanging moss and vast regions of giant fungi and mushrooms. 
The three layers of the Happy Hunting Grounds are all covered with a variety of huge plants and tangled underbrush, but maybe told from each other by their skies:

Krigala is the topmost layer of the plane, closest to the Astral. Through it the Oceanus flows in a relatively straight course (compared to its tortured winding in Elysium) into Olympus. Portals to the topmost planes of Olympus, Elysium, and Concordant Opposition usually appear in this plane as large openings in hollow trees. These portals can be in any type of tree, but the same tree type always leads to the same plane (silver-plated beeches always lead to Olympus, for example) Krigala is continually lit by a midday sun, a great orb that Remains at the zenith no matter where the traveler is in the plane. The warmth of this sun varies sharply from realm to realm, so there are foggy regions that suddenly end in clear weather that in turn becomes unspoiled fields of snow in the next realm. The weather in one realm does not affect that in adjacent realms.
 

Brux is the second of the three layers of the Beastlands. It can be reached from Krigala in the standard manner of moving from one planar layer to another. Brux'sterrain varies in the same degree a s Krigala's, with all manner of plants and forested areas existing in the plane. Brux's sky is reddish, lit by two setting suns (or rising suns) that appear to be at opposite sides of the horizon. (An optimist says the suns of Brux are rising, a pessimist that they are setting)


Karasuthra is the farthest of the three known layers of the plane. This is a realm of a starlit night (though some realms may have overcast skies or fogs). The stars of this realm are not moored in the sky-they wander in a random fashion that defies all studies


All spells and special abilities function in the Beastlands with the standard limitations for the outer planes. In addition, those spells and abilities that permit the identification of and communication with plants and animals (though not their summoning or control) function in all layers of this plane. However, any attempt to control winds, weather, or air is prevented by the creatures t hat make the aerial region their home ~

@322=~Advanced studies of the nature of the planes... Olympus ~
@324=~Olympus
The vaults of Olympus (and those of neighboring Gladsheim) are at first glance a quandary. Their position in the great wheel of the outer planes places both of them on the chaotic side of the wheel, yet both of them sport organized pantheons. Olympus is the home of the Greek and elvish pantheons, while Gladsheim is the native land of the Norse mythos. In truth ,only the top most layer of each plane is dominated by The realms of these mythoi, but their realms hold sway over such a large area that extraplanar travelers and scholars took the planes names from these mythoi. In the case of Olympus, the Greek pantheon receives the nod (and the name) due to the existence of the permanent multiplanar conduit known as Mt. Olympus
Of secondary importance is the fact that most of the barriers in the realms controlled by the elvish and Greek pantheons are tightly controlled by these pantheons. The barriers to the layers adjacent to the elvish lands open into the water layer of Tethys , while those in the Greek realms connect to small islands In that infinite sea.
For this reason, in Prime Material planes where the elvish and Greek pantheons are worshiped, this plane is known as Olympus In the planes where Mount Olympus does not exist and the gods of the ancient Greeks are therefore unknown, the plane is known as Arvandor, the High Forest, and its layers are given elvish names. The plane of Olympus is divided into three layers:

Olympus (or Arvandor) is the name of the topmost  layer of the plane as well as that of the plane itself. It is the domain of the realms of the elvish and Greek pantheons, which are separated by a few thousand miles of wilderlands unclaimed by any realm. This layer is one of steep mountains cut by great passes and monstrous broadleaf trees rivaling the heights of sequoias. Its hillocks are the size of Prime planar mountains
They are covered with arbors of grapes, untended orchards, and fields of wild wheat The layer itself is slightly convex, so that while Olympus and Arvandor both occupy the highest pinnacles of land within their realms, neither citadel can see the other. Away from the settled and claimed areas, the layer grows wild quickly. Many fell beasts and creatures such as giants and cyclops roam the lands to challenge those who adventure within

Ossa (called Aquallor by the elves) and its barriers are usually found in the watery domains of Sashelas of the elves and Poseidon of the Greeks. It is the outflow of the river Oceanus which began in the farthest layer of Elysium, Thalasia. (There are often reports of huge, funnel-like maelstroms that lead directly back to Thalasia in an unending circle.) Unlike Thalasia and the waters of Lunia in the first of the Seven Heavens, the seas of Ossa are for the most part shallow, no more than three feet in depth over most of the realm. Great chasms open up in places there, and it is in these that other chaotic good sea gods make their domains.

Pelion (called Mithardir {white dust] in the elvish tongue) is the third layer of Olympus. It is a dusty place of blowing white sand and snow. It is temperate in most of its domains, but all things are covered by the dust. Both Greek and elvish pantheons have their own legends concerning other powerful beings who once dwelt in these regions. They are now gone and their realms and the treasures are buried beneath the dust. What creatures or powers still live within this disintegrating land is unknown even to the more adventurous of the deities.

As noted above, the barriers from the first to second layer and those from the second to third layer, tend to be rarer than those found in the other outer planes. The portals from the adjacent planes have been identified by the ruling Powers. They appear as spinning crimson disks that do not reveal their egress points for anything less than divination spells. The Powers of the plane have located the permanent portals from their domains within a few thousand leagues of their abodes in all directions. They have surrounded these portals with stone walls and iron gates, not so much to stop intruders as to slow the curious and prevent dangerous and stupid creatures from wandering in.
Neither of the great pantheons worry much about extraplanar viewing points zipping through their realms, but those that are  particularly bothersome (remaining too long in one spot, as if Belonging to a thief casing the joint) are dispelled and the peeping mage and company are brought into the outer plane for instruction in the dangers of such viewing. ~

@325=~Otherworld Gods...... Vecna~
@327=~Many tales are told of the Archlich Vecna.
It is said that Vecna was one of the Planes' mightiest sorcerers, able to draw life from dust and send it back again, extinguish lives with a glance, and make the earth shudder beneath his touch. He was said to be so powerful that when the end of his life drew near, death refused to take him into its kingdom. 
  And so Vecna died, yet lived on.
  Abandoned by death, Vecna became the master of a vast kingdom on a prime world called Oerth. Neither kind nor just, Lord Vecna's rule was one of great horror and suffering, and it is said his reach was so great that even the Powers of Oerth feared to cross him, for fearing of drawing his eye.
  Yet, while Vecna's gaze traveled ever outward in search of new conquests, he failed to see his own end when it came for him... in the form of his lieutenant, Kas. 
  As was fitting for Vecna's left hand servant, the Archlich had fashioned a terrible weapon for his lieutenant as a symbol of his authority. Vecna made this weapon with such skill it is said that part of the sorcerer entered the blade, and it was this sliver of Vecna that gave the blade its life and its treacherous nature. Where once there was lifeless steel, there became thought, intent, and, perhaps most horrible of all, a voice. 
  The sword whispered treacheries to the ambitious Kas, night upon night, month upon month, year upon year, until one night, the remains of Kas' discipline was seduced by the rippling edge of the blade. Convinced by his blade that he was Vecna's superior, Kas confronted his dread master upon his Desiccated Throne, and the two of them fought a terrible battle. 
  During the battle, Kas was killed, but before he fell, his blade had dismembered his former master, scattering his remains so that no one may draw them together again. And so it has come to pass that pieces of Vecna have made their way across the Planes... one of these is the hand of Vecna. It carries with it a bloody, violent history, so much so that many scholars refuse to speak of its treacheries, for fear the hand will come to them, seeking to add another victim to its bloody chronology.
  The hand of Vecna was instrumental in the extermination of the House of Hyeric, once the ruling dynasty in Nyrond. It is said to have been behind the sundering of the Conclave of Tyssis-on-the-Sea, which led to the three-cycle war that poisoned the seas of Malhatai and left the oceanic world barren of life. On the ashen Plane of Ghalentir, it possessed the gentle father of Sasaran, a babe with the potential to lead his suffering people from their shadowed lands to the Gates of Paradise... had not the hand drove Sasaran's father to murder his son as he lay sleeping in his crib. All these kingdoms, all these futures, the hand of Vecna laid waste.~

@328=~The Hand and Eye of Vecna, myth Artifact or more?~
@330=~Most sages know and tell the tale of Vecna the greatest of the arch liches,But some greater scholars ( Elminster for one ! ) have asked questions of the tale, questions such as "why did Vecna become a lich", "how did this ,admittedly powerful, undead mage gain the ability to dominate a huge kingdom and inspire enough fear in the greater and lesser gods to keep it! " and " Given that many of the pieces of Vecna before his ascension are artifacts ( including the First Digit (right thumb), Second Digit (right index finger), Third Digit (right middle finger), Last Digit (right pinky finger), Incisors (a pair of inappropriately named fang-like canines), Molar, Scalp, Skin, Heart, Foot (left), and Right Eye ) Why does Vecna the lesser God always appear without a Eye and Hand.

The answer is both simple and complex. Vecna was born as a human, centuries ago as a member of the untouchable caste in the Flan city of Fleeth on Oerth. He was initially trained by his mother, Mazzel, in the art of magic, before she was executed by the government of Fleeth for practicing witchcraft. Vowing revenge, Vecna eventually assumed a mastery of the dark arts achieved by no mortal before or since. Some say this achievement was due to direct tutelage by Mok'slyk the Serpent, believed to be the personification of arcane magic itself. And it was the serpent himself who showed his pupil the complex astral path that led to the secret location of the hand and eye, after battles with demigods daemons and worse! they were his and like all the previous owners he cut of his own hand, gouged out his own eye and fitted the alien things. It was not two years hence before he realised he had aged 15, and that his life was being inexorably and quickly eaten away by his new acquisitions, his only answer was immortality, and the only sure method of that was becoming a Lich, which again with the serpents help he did.

Nearly one thousand years later his Vecna, now a ruler of a great and terrible empire (in the Sheldomar Valley, centered near the modern-day Rushmoors), laid siege to the city of Fleeth with an army of arcane spellcasters and undead. On the verge of conquering Fleeth, the officials of the city came before him to beg for mercy. They offered up the entire city and her wealth if only Vecna would spare the lives of her citizens. When Vecna was not satisfied, the officials offered their own lives. Vecna gave one of their number, Artau, and his family, over to his lieutenant, Kas, who spent the entire day torturing and murdering them before the other officials. Still unsatisfied, Vecna slaughtered all within the city, and had their heads stacked before the officials, with those of their family members prominent. Vecna then granted his mercy, granting the officials leave to depart, and promising them his protection for the rest of their lives.

At his empire's height, Vecna was betrayed and destroyed by his most trusted lieutenant, a vampire called Kas the Bloody-Handed, using a magical sword that Vecna himself had crafted for him, Kas struck of the hand while Vecna laid dormant and the eye too was removed before Vecna could fully wake. In the battle that followed the hand and eye were once again set adrift among the outer planes. Many years later when Vecna had returned to ascend to demi-godhood he learned the final legacy of having owned the items, no matter what he did, regeneration, wishing, etc etc etc he could not regain his left Eye and hand, something which was trivial with all the other bits that were cut off him !~

@331=~Notes on the planes~
@333=~The common model is just that, a simple model to understand the hand i.e. need more!

1)All the inner planes are finite in terms of size, but too big to comprehend.
2)All the inner planes share the same time space.
3)The Prime material plane is made up of many worlds separated by space, arranged as galaxys,suns,planets etc
4)The Elemental planes, negative material and positive material are basically continuous having no planets etc

5)The ethereal plane separates and connects all the inner planes, but to be more accurate it is not a plane at all. When any two things in this multiverse are brought together in physical contact ( cup and ball ) there is never a point in space where a line can be drawn between the two, if one looks close enough one sees a gradual transition from the particles of what can be called the cup to the particles of what can be called the ball. The same is true of the planes, where the prime material joins the negative material (for example ) there is no sudden transition, there is a grey area where the prime and negative are effectively the same, this is the ethereal "plane".

6)In the same manner the astral plane is the membrane between all the outer planes , the alternate primes and the alternate ethereals

7)The fundamental forces within the inner planes are gravity and magic, both are a result of the ethereal membrane, how exactly this occurs I have yet to discover.

@334=~Gods by Cuthbert~
@336=~"Gods are formed by worship
There are three tiers of gods (ignoring pantheons ).
The elder gods..... Zeus Odin Ra etc.. They are all powerful in their respective planes and very old, they work through avatars and the leaser gods they command, They control the fate of souls of devoted that travel to their realm after death.
The new gods..... Helm, Omah, Mysteria......... These new gods are spawned every time the universe has a cycle change, not as  powerful as the old gods, often perishing in battles or fading through lack of worship, only a few tend to survive cycle changes and progress to becoming elder gods. They exist on parts of the outer planes, with the permission of the elder gods who control the respective alignment plane.
Elemental deities, Heroes, Demi gods, Powerful humans....A host of these creatures exist, displaying in measure godlike power and abilities, sometimes worshiped by cults but rarely gaining enough worship to progress to spawning clerics and new god status.

NB... Gods are not the most powerful beings in the universe, this accolade belongs to the elder beings. Creatures that were here before gods and in some cases before the universe itself was made and oh yes, 2 humans."

@337=~The Hand and Eye of Vecna, the true story..... A secret work by Lum~
@339=~The ethereal plane is not a uniform membrane, the barrier has countless folds tunnels, knots and holes so passage through the ethereal plane can be random at best ( indeed that is why the teleport spell can lead one to appear in a rock or a week in the past! ) this also leads to areas within the prime material where the fundamental forces can vary in strength and it is in one of these places, where magic is so faint as to be undetectable, that our tale begins.


There once was a small world at the edge of a magic less galaxy that was home to many humans, they lived without mages clerics or supernatural beings, and even the gods of the outer planes could not send their avatars through the natural barrier of folded ethereal membrane ( with a few extremely rare exceptions ).

Naturally these humans, as all humans seem to be, were a warlike race, and without magic or gods they waged war with weapons and machines, time passed, their numbers grew and so did their intelligence, yet the wars still raged, now fought with machines that could inflict damage on a scale unimaginable by even the greatest arch mage, still their intelligence grew, still the wars raged, still the machines got more powerful. One would think this cycle would stop but on this one world ( maybe unique in the multiverse ) it did not.

Finally 2 great nations formed and without pause went to war, huge machines fought each other to destruction all over the globe and in nearby space. the  two sides were equally matched in intelligence skill and ruthlessness so the war raged for 500 years then there was born a man ( on the NearAsia side ) who?s intelligence and evil could not be measured and who?s name is now  cursed by gods themselves. Dr Hastur

He used his godlike intelligence to create a great thinking machine into which he poured his very soul, his very life-force, leaving his body a lifeless husk, this machine serviced by countless minor machines and humans was given the task of once and for all defeating the NearAEura forces, and so the great machine went  to work. Unfortunately no one thought to check the work and no one wandered weather Dr Hasturs evil could be within the machine along with his life-force, the war was raging after all! Until exactly 1 year later from a fully automated underground bunker the brothers emerged.

Two human like machines, golems with powers to destroy mountains and indeed they did end the war. The first day they destroyed all the war machines of both sides, the second day they killed all the human warriors of both sides! In fact any creature which could put up the slightest challenge. Then having nothing left to kill they simply went to sleep watched over by the great machine ( now serviced exclusively by other machines ).

The flood of souls from this cataclysm did not go unnoticed in the outer planes, indeed Zeus himself ordered a expedition of greater Olympian deities to find out what was going on, since no avatar could penetrate the ethereal distortions it was decided to ask one of the uber powerful elder beings to help, and curious herself Phoenix agreed, so finally, after some good humored debate as to which god would go, Phoenix flew to the Sol system carrying an avatar of Hermes in her talons, punching a hole in the ethereal membrane ( as only an elder being can do ) and bringing magic to sol for the first time.

So it was exactly one year after the twins were "born" that Hermes stood on Sol and marveled at the carnage.
The presence of such a powerful somehow being awoke 11 and 12 ( the "names" the great machine had assigned the 2 brothers ) who thinking they were facing a powerful human warrior who had somehow avoided their gaze, did battle with relish.

They had a moment of surprise before Hermes turned them into 2 piles of molten scrap.
Although the twins had power to destroy mountains and physical strength greater than Hercules himself, they had never seen magic before, they were venerable to the simplest cantrip let alone spells cast by an higher god they could not even teleport!

Thinking the problem solved and the souls of the brave human warriors avenged Hermes left to the important task of converting as much of this virgin galaxy to the Olympian pantheon as possible before the other gods of the outer planes found the hole left by Phoenix and came to fight for worshipers.

But Hermes was not Helm! Hermes, Quicksilver, on feet of wings always a little too quick even with his gods eyes did not see the great machine observing the battle with the twins, did not see tiny machines recovering the memory components of 11 and 12, did not notice the great machine once again working.

100 years roll by and memory of the great machine and the cataclysm of Sol passed into history, sol was now a peaceful place having turned its back on the technology that was blamed for the cataclysm, clerics and the worship of Zeus flourished, all seemed well. Yet in a remote valley beneath a river the great machine had been working hard, and from the same bunker emerged Rhin and Qwill.

Stronger faster and more sophisticated than their predecessors, they appeared almost human ( apart from the rather obvious 3 eyes and six fingered hands ), but more than that they were clothed in regenerating flesh essential to contain the magical forces the great machine had analyzed and copied during its observation of Hermes. And what power it was ! They started life as arch mages with no limit on further progression, they could learn and gain experience, more than that they had the ability to effortlessly travel through the ethereal at least as well as Hermes!

As everything else had been upgraded so had the brothers wisdom, they could laugh joke and philosophies, yet their basic nature remained the same, they wanted only to fight and kill worthy opponents and in the process become better killers.
So pausing only to enjoy their first sunrise they slipped through the now permanent membrane hole into the multiverse proper.

The next few weeks saw the mysterious disappearance of many great heroes, demigods and powerful beings throughout widely dispersed locations within the prime material, as the two carved a bloody path gaining magic ability and experience at a exponential rate, the gods made oblivious by powerful anti divination magic?s weaved into the brothers did not see their peril till Rin and Qwill stood before the gates of Olympus politely asking to see Hermes.

Naturally Zeus is not to be underestimated, he was warned of the twins arrival centuries back by the fates and warned of the danger, but he was a elder god after all and arrogant in his power especially in his home plane. Thus the twins were greeted by most of the Olympian pantheon reigned against them. The battle raged for 12 hours, Zeus commanded the very substance of Olympus to fight against the intruders, yet Qwill held equilibrium by forming a direct gate to the negative material, and in the equilibrium Rhin dealt with the Olympians. The titans died first, only a few remained to retreat after the first salvo of energy and magic bolts that came from Rhin the rest of the battle was no less bloody, by sun fall Zeus had retreated badly wounded and the rest of the gods were fighting a retreat in the face of both the twins now active ( Qwill no longer had to hold equilibrium since Zeus was out of the picture ). It seemed all was lost for the Olympian gods, then at the last moment Zeus in his desperation allowed access to Olympus, and accepted help from anyone who would give it, And help came.

Suddenly the twins faced not only the Olympians but Odin and the Norse pantheon (avatars) and Ra and the Egyptian pantheon (avatars) the combined magical and physical force of these gods smashed into the pair and for a second it seemed that their time was up. But Rhin just smiled for the twins knew they had been given power by the great machine that they had dare not use, until now, power copied from a brief glimpse of phoenix before she had left the sol system, power of an elder being, such was the nature of this power that it had a good chance of destroying the twins if their bodies could not contain it. The twins gambled, and the gamble paid off. Most of the avatars were destroyed in seconds, such was the savagery that Odin lost his real eye as a force wave blew his avatar apart and rippled back down the silver cord to his real body.

Now bright as the sun with pure force the two turned their attention to what remained of the Olympians but before they could unleash the bolt that would turn Olympus into powder chance smiled on the gods. For two others came to see what the commotion was all about, not gods , not heroes, but 2 Elder beings.

Balor one eye was the first daemon, indeed all daemon kind were created ( by various dark gods )as a homage to this being.
Jack the Bodiless was half human half something else and was the greatest of his race of Psionic operant masters.

The two were good friends after having a bit of a rumble a few centuries back, and were having tea in a very nice spot of the astral plane when they sensed an almighty disturbance in the astral membrane, so naturally they went to have a look.

They were taken aback and a little angry when on arrival the twins took them for enemies and attacked, then when Rhin actually drew blood ( Balors ) and Qwill managed to give jack a headache, then they revealed their true forms and power.

Such was the force unleashed in that next second that some sages to the gods have theorized that the multiverse was set of balance at that moment, and all the climactic ages from that moment to now have been a consequence of that one exchange of fire.

Rhin and Qwill battled bravely and fiercely pushing their body integrity to the limit. Yet they were forced back, forced from Olympus, forced from the astral and finally fought back to the prime. There the battle paused, becoming very tired and having made their point Balor and Jack left the twins buried under a mountain of rubble, and as a parting shot destroyed the great machine ( with a telekinetic bolt from jack which re/arranged that continent ! )
Over the next day all sides took a breather and licked their wounds, the gods especially Olympus had lost many, the twins had lost the great machine which meant no resurrection, and Jack and Balor had left going back to whatever business Elder beings have.

This still left the gods in a dilemma, when the twins came back , which surely they would, there would be no elder beings there to save them. But the situation had changed, the great machine was gone which meant the soul of Dr Hastur was now in Hades and no longer tied to the machine, this Zeus knew and after a did of bargaining gained access to.

And so Zeus learned the weaknesses of his enemies, and a fatal weakness it was, the two were created in parts and activated by the assembly of the last part, In the case of Rhin the left hand and with Qwill the central eye. Thus if these pieces were to be removed the machines would become inactive. It was Loki greatest of all thieves who took on the task, armed with Dr Hasturs removal instructions, skill, whit and concealment only the greatest of thieves could achieve, the deed was done.

Yet Dr Hastur even after his death managed to shield his creations, by withholding from Zeus one final secret, once deactivated the twins would be automatically teleported back to their birth bunker a location that even the doctor did not know, the whereabouts were destroyed along with the great machine.

Thus Loki was left alone holding just an eye and hand, 

Over the next few millennia much effort was spent trying to find that bunker, but no trace was ever found, as for the eye and hand it was found that these 2 artifacts contained much power, even though they were the weakest parts of Rhin and Qwill, they were still parts of god killers. it was also found with the proper enchantments the items could be grafted onto mortals and godlings alike and that power used to a fashion, but with some nasty side effects.

So time moved on, the hand and eye being the centre of many intrigues and fights between the ever warring gods, passing from one god to another, eventually being rejected by all gods because of the trouble ( power imbalances ) owning them caused, eventually passing into the realm of heroes and mortals.

Obviously the true tale of these items was lost as the generations passed, of mortals and gods alike since the multiverse was now prone to strange cycles where even gods could die, and as each new owner claimed it for themselves.~

Sages speculate that the mage is infact one of the children of Mystra as he has had a great propensity for magic since birth.  This robe is truly a gift that any practicioner of the arts would sacrifice much to acquire.

@183=~The Love of Black Bess~
@185=~This fell weapon was crafted by a beautiful and cruel wizardess who worshipped the lady of misfortune, Beshaba.  Her name was Redani, and she was known both for her powers as an enchanter and a seductress.  The Love of Black Bess was always given to her favored consort at any particular time.  Unknown to her lovers, she would place a Ring of Readiness on the mace, saving the matching ring for a special time.  When she grew tired of her consorts, as she always did, she would give the matching ring to a new lover and send the young man out to kill her old paramour.  The new lover would simply call upon the ring and the mace would fly to his hand.

Unfortunately, Redani was done in when she trusted the wrong man to kill her old lover.  Gural of Chessenta, a well-disguised priest of Hoar, took it upon himself to gain vengeance for a man whose skull he had picked up by the side of a road.  Unluckily for Redani, priests of Hoar will go to any length to avenge the dead, even if it means animating all of her dead lovers to tear her limb from limb.

@199=~Amulet of the Arch wizard~
@201=~These light, gold medallions on silver chains were worn under the clothes of an arch wizard.  Each was stamped with the coat-of-arms of a particular city (so people thought it was nothing more than a status symbol).  The amulet acted as an amulet of proof against detection and location.  It allowed the wearer to teleport without error to any area of the city of Athkatla with the utterance of a command word.  Individual arch wizards placed additional incantations on these amulets to suit their personal tastes and paranoia, such as a removable clasp that could be tossed aside just before the arcanist teleported away that activated like a delayed blast fireball.  This particular Amulet of the Arch wizard will only work if the user is on the mainland of Faerun, thus the magic will have no effect in such places as the Underdark, the island of Brynnlaw, or other locations such as islands or other planes.

The wearer can detach a crystal and hurl it up to 80 feet before it melted down in his hands after 1 turn.  When the crystal reaches the end of its trajectory, it explodes in an Ice Storm.

A Blast Scepter is self-identifying and has the following powers:
 - the user is immune to fire and lightning while holding the scepter
 - the user cannot be knocked down or moved by a blast or detonation while holding the scepter.  The user takes half damage from any blast, such as a Horn of Blasting, Smokepowder detonation, or the blast power from another Blast Scepter (one-quarter with a successful saving throw)
 - the user can stun a target by making a melee touch attack with the scepter.  The creature can avoid being stunned with a successful save versus wands, but is stunned for 1d4 rounds if the save fails (this power drains 1 charge)
 - the user can blast opponents with a soundless wave of force in a cone 30 feet long.  Targets automatically take 2d6 points of damage and must make a save versus wands or be knocked off their feet (this power drains 2 charges)
 - the user can powerstrike any creature or object with a melee touch attack.  The touch deals 10d6 points of damage, a Wand Save reduces this by half (this power drains 4 charges)

Basil Swiftbough's name will live on in his native Tethyr not because of the great deeds accomplished during his lifetime or because of the endowments he made to charitable institutions, but because the descendants of the 182 children he fathered are still trying to figure out where Basil hid the treasure that enabled him to live a life of ease, seducing village maidens and naive noblewomen alike in his quest for the perfect lover. One item that has been recovered from this alleged hoard is this Amulet of Freedom. While it may not have prevented the siring of any of his numerous progeny, it undoubtably contributed to his ability to evade potential entanglements once the lady's condition became known. In addition to a minor bonus to charisma, this amulet enables the wearer to ignore any hindrance that might afffect his mobility, and grants a small measure of protection in the form of a bonus to saving throws. Some people have all the luck.

When worn, it does what little thought possible... give the Robe of Vecna some much-needed competition. Good protection is hard to come by for wizards.

@665=~Long Sword Hilt~
@666=~Zeladazar, The Ghost Sword~
@667=~Long Sword Hilt, This is the hilt of a long sword.  It appears to have been forged by a fine craftsman, even though the blade was broken off long ago and the pommel is obviously missing a large gem.~
@668=~The Ghost Sword is a long sword whose blade is invisible, though gilimmers of light may sometimes bee seen flashing along the unseen steel when it strikes something- armor for example- that bears an enchantment.  All that is normally visible of Zeladazar is a heavy steal hilt, from quillons to pommel. The pommel nut is a burnished steel sphere as large as a small orange.  The grip is wrapped in black leather, and the visible metal is blued, smooth-worn, and massive.

In the waning, decadent days of Netheril, a peculiar (for his people) sorcerer named Twyluth Ornadyn hit upon the idea that the salvation of the Netherese lay in turning their magical skills and lives back to living in harmorny with nature and other living things.  Ornadyn foresaw the need for battle magic to safeguard the survival of the Netherese as they learned the ways of all life, and he envisaged an armory of enchanted blades whose wielders could communicate with each other over long distances through meditation and the blades' transmission of mental images and audible speech.  He set about making a pair of these blades to test relevant existing magic and to develop new spells as necessary- but was slain by a treacherous apprentics, who snatched up one of the blades in the midst of it being imbued with an enchantment and beheaded Ornadyn.  The headless archmage's body lived on through previously cast defensive magics and took up the other sword to avenge himself.  In the ensuing battle, Ornadyn was hacked apart, but one of the blades exploded, destroying the apprentice utterly.
The surviving sword was found and passed into the possession of the Netherese archwizard Alados Sorngol, who dubbed it the Sword of Dreams because of the visions handling it brought.  These images were sourced in the blade's enchantments and the revenant spirit of Ornadyn, who sent phantoms to frighten Alados ant to wrest control of the blade from him.  Their success was such that the terrified Alados bound new spells into the blade to make it a destroyer of undead- but died anyway when Ornadyn sent a last "blood spell" through the blade, searing the vitality of Alados with Ornadyn's own unlife, so that the essences of the two mages destroyed each other.

STATISTICS:

Only magic can make the invisible blade of Zeladazar visible.  Whenever it is drawn, its wielder is immune to paralysis, energy drain, as well as enjoying the benefits of a Ring of Free Action.  Its wielder is able to move and attack freely and normally, even when attacked by a Web, Hold, or Slow spell (which Zeladazar gives its wielder complete immunity to) or when underwater (though the sword does not empower an air-breathing being to breathe under water).
The Ghost Sword does 1d12 points of damage to all living creatures (regardless of size), and 4d12 points per successful strike to all undead creatures.  The touch of the blade destroys ghosts upon contact.

@5=~Eye~
@6=~Eye Of Vecna~
@7=~A strange disembodied eye, like nothing you have ever seen before, at first glance it seems to come from a mummy or dried corpse of some kind,
once throughly examined patches of some silver unknown metal appear to be underneath the anchient sinue.
It radiates power and evil, this is obviously an artifact.~
@8=~The magic of the eye defies identification, as does the metal that runs through the item.
But the divination triggers an anchient glyph, cast by the long dead, Lum.
The glyph writing tells the true story of the eye ( of Vecna ? ), and details the powers and effects a mortal is likly to expect when using this infernal item.

  "Vecna was one of the Planes' mightiest sorcerers, able to draw life from dust and send it back again, extinguish lives with a glance, and make the earth shudder beneath his touch. He was said to be so powerful that when the end of his life drew near, death refused to take him into its kingdom. 
  And so Vecna died, yet lived on.
  Abandoned by death, Vecna became the master of a vast kingdom on a prime world called Oerth. Neither kind nor just, Lord Vecna's rule was one of great horror and suffering, and it is said his reach was so great that even the Powers of Oerth feared to cross him, for fearing of drawing his eye.
  Yet, while Vecna's gaze traveled ever outward in search of new conquests, he failed to see his own end when it came for him... in the form of his lieutenant, Kas. 
  As was fitting for Vecna's left hand servant, the Archlich had fashioned a terrible weapon for his lieutenant as a symbol of his authority. Vecna made this weapon with such skill it is said that part of the sorcerer entered the blade, and it was this sliver of Vecna that gave the blade its life and its treacherous nature. Where once there was lifeless steel, there became thought, intent, and, perhaps most horrible of all, a voice. 
  The sword whispered treacheries to the ambitious Kas, night upon night, month upon month, year upon year, until one night, the remains of Kas' discipline was seduced by the rippling edge of the blade. Convinced by his blade that he was Vecna's superior, Kas confronted his dread master upon his Desiccated Throne, and the two of them fought a terrible battle. 
  During the battle, Kas was killed, but before he fell, his blade had dismembered his former master, scattering his remains so that no one may draw them together again. And so it has come to pass that pieces of Vecna have made their way across the Planes... one of these is the hand of Vecna. It carries with it a bloody, violent history, so much so that many scholars refuse to speak of its treacheries, for fear the hand will come to them, seeking to add another victim to its bloody chronology.
  The hand of Vecna was instrumental in the extermination of the House of Hyeric, once the ruling dynasty in Nyrond. It is said to have been behind the sundering of the Conclave of Tyssis-on-the-Sea, which led to the three-cycle war that poisoned the seas of Malhatai and left the oceanic world barren of life. On the ashen Plane of Ghalentir, it possessed the gentle father of Sasaran, a babe with the potential to lead his suffering people from their shadowed lands to the Gates of Paradise... had not the hand drove Sasaran's father to murder his son as he lay sleeping in his crib. All these kingdoms, all these futures, the hand of Vecna laid waste."
  
  So reads the classical history of the Artifacts known as the hand and eye of Vecna, yet the truth is more strange and much more interesting.
  The hand and eye were not of Vecna, he was simply the most recent owner. These two items come from a time when the muliverse was young , AO was young. And have been owned by Lesser gods, Demi-gods and the like.
  So a more accurate history would read
  
  "Vecna was born as a human, centuries ago as a member of the untouchable caste in the Flan city of Fleeth on Oerth. He was initially trained by his mother, Mazzel, in the art of magic, before she was executed by the government of Fleeth for practicing witchcraft. 
  Vowing revenge, Vecna eventually assumed a mastery of the dark arts achieved by no mortal before or since. Some say this achievement was due to direct tutelage by Mok'slyk the Serpent, believed to be the personification of arcane magic itself.
  With the assistance of the selfsame serpent Vecna walked the astral pathways searching for the secret location of the hand and eye, after battles with demigods daemons and worse! they were his and like all the previous owners he cut of his own hand, gouged out his own eye and fitted the alien things.
  Possesion of those items provoked the interest of high and low divine powers, and thrust Vecna directly into the malestrom of divine politics. Thus it was that upon his death the gods of the underworld granted him further time to wreak chaos on the planes.
  Nearly one thousand years later his Vecna, now a ruler of a great and terrible empire (in the Sheldomar Valley, centered near the modern-day Rushmoors), laid siege to the city of Fleeth with an army of arcane spellcasters and undead. On the verge of conquering Fleeth, the officials of the city came before him to beg for mercy. 
  They offered up the entire city and her wealth if only Vecna would spare the lives of her citizens. When Vecna was not satisfied, the officials offered their own lives. Vecna gave one of their number, Artau, and his family, over to his lieutenant, Kas, who spent the entire day torturing and murdering them before the other officials.
  Still unsatisfied, Vecna slaughtered all within the city, and had their heads stacked before the officials, with those of their family members prominent.  Vecna then granted his mercy, granting the officials leave to depart, and promising them his protection for the rest of their lives.
  At his empire's height, Vecna was betrayed and destroyed by his most trusted lieutenant, a vampire called Kas the Bloody-Handed, using a magical sword that Vecna himself had crafted for him,
  Kas struck of the hand while Vecna laid dormant and the eye too was removed before Vecna could fully wake. In the battle that followed the hand and eye were once again set adrift among the outer planes.
  Many years later when Vecna had returned to ascend to demi-godhood he learned the final legacy of having owned the items, no matter what he did, regeneration, wishing, etc etc etc he could not regain his left Eye and hand,
  To this day Vecna cultists search relentlesly for any trace of the items"

  Karsus was perhaps the most powerful of Arch mages to come to power in ancient Netheril, and one of the most foolish, for he attempted to seize Godhood through his magic, and failed, being punished with an eternity of torment. Karsus' spells are renowned for their power, and this is no exception, being one of his most potent death magics.
  When cast, the target is surrounded by an aura of magical crimson flames that literally burn the life of the target away. The flames last for 4 rounds, and each round the target must make a Save vs Death or be instantly killed. Even if the target resists the death magic, they are overcome with fear at being surrounded with the flames, and will run in fear until the flames extinguish. While a target is surrounded by the flames, their regeneration (if any) will cease, and they will be immune to all healing magics.~

@368=~Life Warping (Necromancy)
Level: 9
Range: 20 Yards
Casting Time: 8
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: vs. spells at -4
Area of Effect: 1 Creature

This spell causes the caster to actually touch and alter the strength of an individual's soul. The spell inflicts just 20 hit points of damage, but the 20 hit points are permanently removed from the target's maximum and cannot be healed. The target does get a saving throw vs spells at -4 to negate the effects of the spell. Such a spell can warp the strongest of souls into submission and can be the factor that decides any do-or-die battle.~
@369=~Molecular Disjointment~
@370=~Molecular Disjointment (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 9
Range: Self
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 target

This spell is an extremely dangerous spell that can however grant immense benefits to the caster. Upon uttering the phrases the mage sustains 1D10 hit points of damage but this is due to the fact that he has split the very molecules that form his present, upon them splitting he will appear little more than a blur and thoughtless attacks will pass straight through his blurry presence. However the spell is very dangerous, after the duration of 6 rounds the molecular structure of the mage will attempt to reform, this 75% of the time is successful but it can fail and if this happens the mage will simply drop dead in the form of what is left of his body. Also though, the spell will make the recipient of the spell very open to magical attacks and will have a -40% magic resistance and receives more damage from magic despite his immunity to almost any physical attack.~

  Saving Throw: None
  
  Azuth, the lord of spells was once a powerful mortal Archmage until he ascended unto godhood. Shortly before he became a god, it is believed he forged this spell. It is perhaps his crowning achievement, even more so than immortality. However, soon after his ascension, this spell was destroyed, or apparently destroyed, by Mystra, for its power was to be feared, even by the Gods. This spell takes a mage a great deal of time of cast. However, when it is finally unleashed, nothing can withstand it. For a single instant it surrounds the target with total nothingness. This nothingness drains magic from the target, severely weakening them. It is perhaps the only way a mage can battle a God, for only a spell such as this can make a God vulnerable to a mage's magic.
  Effects:
  This spell wipes away magical resistances. When cast, the targets resistance to fire/ice/cold/magical damage will be set to -25%. Magic resistance will be set to 0. All physical and magical protections surrounding the caster will also be removed.~

  Level: 8
  Casting Time : 12
  Range: Caster
  Saving Throw: Neg.
  
  Tereledra was a powerful archmage who resided on the plane of dust, a plane that sucks the life out of its inhabitants. Tereledra had long traveled the planes and had built up many enemies especially in the anarchist faction of Sigil. After being attacked by a group of anarchist wild mages he decided to give it all up, change his name and vanish. 
  For many years he journeyed the inner planes free of his old foes. He joined with a well respected group of mercenaries and traveled with them long, eventually he confided in them his old and secret identity, feeling he could trust them. Little had he bargained on the size of the anarchists reward for his head. The mercenary group turned on him. They underestimated his power and Tereledra in a fit of rage slew them all consigning their souls to a pocket plane to serve him for all eternity. This spell their only gateway to the rest of the planes. It is believed that Tereledra was later slain when one of the wraith company was resurrected by a sympathetic priest, the freed wraith killed Tereledra in a single stroke.  This spell will call forth 5 to 10 wraiths of Tereledra's old mercenary group. The wraiths will serve the caster for 2 hours before returning to their pocket plane. The wraiths are fighters of between 7th and 10th level carrying +1 equipment. The wraiths will serve the caster without question but cannot communicate with anything else. The wraiths will also serve Tereledra before any other so they are incapable of fighting him or in any way inconveniencing him. ~

  Vecna one of the most talented and evil mages ever to inhabit the multiverse created this spell and even after his ascension to godhood it remained his favorite spell, it would amuse him to see the fear in enemies eyes as they died a slow very painful death being mercilessly cut apart by very sharp phantom blades. And often ,it is said, he would laugh with gusto when weak enemies would fall quickly and then their bodies be literally cut into small chunks.
  Effects:
  This spell creates a maelstrom of semi ethereal blades that attack the unfortunate victim of the spell, the blades will pass straight through any armor rematerializing just in time to slash and hack then slipping back into the near ethereal membrane. There is no protection from these blades as they pass straight through common spells such as Stoneskin, Protection from magical weapons etc... and are unaffected by magic resistance. But natural or magical effects which reduce slashing damage do apply since they toughen the entire body rather than act as a shield which the blades may pass through.
  The victim will suffer 10hp slashing damage twice per round for 5 rounds from the attacks of the blades, the attack will continue even after the victims death, the blades still doing their grizzly work  ~

  Area of Effect: 250 radius
  Saving Throw: Half
  
  Vecna created this spell to combat powerful crteatures he faced on his many journys to alternate Prime Material Planes. By any definition it is a materpiece of magical script, and a masterwork on lateral thinking. This spell, like the 9th lv spell Gate, creates a gate between one place and another. One end of the gate is located within casting range of the spell, again as the Gate spell, the other end though instead of being created on one of the infernal planes ( and allowing infernal creatures to enter the prime ) is created on the corona of a meadium sized sun. The effect of this is dramatic, for a few seconds, before the massive energy transfer closes the gate, the full force of the stars heat,light,radiation,pressure and gravity blasts throgh the failing gate onto the targert location. Any beings caught within 40ft of the targert location will face the stars energy directly, with no save, all others within 250ft of the bast radius will get a saving throw for half dammage ( this includes the caster ).
  Effects:
  All within 40ft of the target location will take 20d10 crushing dammage, 15d10 fire dammage, will be poisoned for 6hp per round (untill cured) and be blinded for 1 turn.
  All others including the caster can save for half dammage, and are blinded for 2 rounds   ~

  This hellish spell could only have been thought up by one as evil as vecna himself, casting it creates an immensly powerful telekinetic pull on any nearby sky rocks, those lumps of earth that pass by our round earth ball, some time after this spell has been cast, the asteroid will land on the location desired by the caster. All in the blast area suffer a huge ammount of crushing and stun dammage, are knocked uncocious, and deafened ( no save ) for 5 rounds. Those in the small 20ft eppicenter are killed instantly, with a save at -6 allowed  ~

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius     
Saving Throw: 1/2     

The Infernal Combustion Enigma was the creation of the powerful yet insane ArchMage, better known as the Arch-Astronomer, in the time of Nethril. This mage had an addiction to fire and made this spell to accommodate to all of his needs (It is noted that this mage died shortly after completing the spell probably from its effects). Nearly all of modern fire spells are included in this cocktail of spells and as such this spell is capable incinerating many a noble adventurer. However, it is a unpredictable spell so it is considered a prime example of spells to be launched from afar.~

Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: none

In some circles of Archmages it is considered rather pathetic to cast a lightning bolt like a weak little mage. So the thunder bolt was developed. While looking to all intensive purposes like a lightning bolt it is however charged a great deal more and capable of doing vast amounts of damage to anything it strikes, including its caster! The bolt will rebound back and forth until all its power is lost and there are few beings which can withstand a hit from this spell.~

@9000=~A ring is a small band of precious metal that is used as jewelry.  Some rare rings have had enchantments placed upon them that confer various magical abilities.  These rings are highly sought after, especially by those of the adventuring profession~
@9001=~The simplest and humblest of staff weapons, the quarterstaff is a length of wood ranging six to nine feet in length. High quality quarter staves are made of stout oak and are shod with metal at both ends. The quarterstaff must be wielded with both hands.~
@9002=~Studded leather armor has little in common with normal leather armor. Instead of a hardened shell, studded leather offers hundreds of metal rivets affixed to a supple backing. The numerous studs form a flexible coat of metal that helps to turn aside slashing and cutting attacks, while the leather itself is little more than a means of securing the rivets in place.~
@9003=~The mace is a direct descendent of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The design of the head varies: some are spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs.~
@9004=~Since the age of Netheril, mages have learned to bestow a wide variety of magical properties upon the everyday objects that surround them. A favorite item of such enchantment is the common robe. It is lightweight, affordable, and holds its enchantment well, thereby making it ideal equipment for a mage. Due to their magical heritage, however, only single-, dual-, and multi-class mages may wear these enchanted robes.~
@9005=~Manual~
@9006=~Judging by the arcane symbols printed on its cover, it is clear that this book is imbued with magical properties of one sort or another. Until you attempt to either read or identify it, however, its precise nature will remain unknown to you.~
@9007=~Full plate armor is the best armor a warrior can buy, both in appearance and protection. The perfectly fitted interlocking plates are specially angled to deflect arrows and blows, and the entire suit is carefully adorned with rich engraving and embossed detail. ~
@9008=~Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword. The bastard sword has a double-edged blade and a long grip, which can accommodate both hands if preferred. The overall length of the bastard sword ranges between four feet and four feet ten inches.~
@9009=~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weapon smiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons, and in an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.~
@9010=~The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faerun. Whereas the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. Thus, it is slightly slower, but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.~
@9011=~Among mankind's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks that had been sharpened at one end. Upon mastering the use of metals, weaponsmiths forged spearheads from iron and steel, and began experimenting with different types of spearheads, thus leading to the development of certain types of polearms.~
@9012=~A necklace is a piece of ornamental metal jewelry usually made of silver, gold, platinum, or other precious metals, and adorned with gems. A necklace is always worn on the neck and can be of any length.~ 
@9013=~Amulets are usually magical devices that are commonly worn around the neck, suspended from a chain. The type of chain that comes with an amulet generally increases the item's aesthetic value, not its magical properties. Only one amulet can be dangled from the neck at a time.~
@9014=~Rods are about three feet long and as thick as your thumb. They are normally found in cases or similar storage places. Rods can be fashioned from metal, wood, ivory, or bone. They can be plain or decorated and carved, tipped, or not.  Rods are powered by charges, unless noted otherwise in the description of a particular rod. Each time the rod is used, one or more charge may be expended.~
@9015=~The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword which ends in a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation both complex and secret, and more an art form than anything else. This blade is an important facet of Kara-Tur culture. To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath. For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is rare. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.~
@9016=~Boots are normally hand-made by cobblers.  Common boots are made by using a form, but good boots are designed for the foot of an individual. ~
@9017=~This class of decorative helmet, made of reinforced leather or metal, covers the face and head. Eye slits and breathing holes come highly recommended.~
@9018=~Consisting of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff averaging six feet in length, the halberd is the oldest and most often used polearm. The axe blade is balanced at the rear with a fluke, and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually of quadrangular design. The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to dismount cavalry. A halberd is best described as a cross between a spear and an axe. ~
@9019=~Potions are typically found in ceramic, crystal, glass, or metal flasks or vials. Flasks or other containers generally contain enough fluid to provide one person with one complete dose to achieve the effects of the potion.~
@9020=~The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term 'short sword' does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.~
@9021=~These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords.  In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era.  Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches.  In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length.  Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting. ~

This and its lightness allows it to be worn by thieves and fighter/mages with few restrictions.~
@9045=~Great Axe~
