@66=~This Astral map spell transports you to a secret location, Lolths lab complex, within a hidden pocket plane, somewhere in the astral. Do you really want to go there ?~
@67=~Yes let the mayhem begin~
@68=~No~
@69=~This spell must be cast from the astral plane or any pocket planes located therein, you are not in an astral area so the spell fails and is wasted~
@70=~Although in an astral area something is blocking your transport, the spell fails and is wasted~
