@1=~Well by Thor, it?s about time you arrived here~
@3=~What?~
@4=~Your treading on thin ice, and one step away from cold steel, explain yourself quickly~
@5=~Urrrr.. Do I know you ?~
@6=~No we have never met but your arrival here on this very spot has been foretold so I am here with a message ; Oh but where are my manners My name is Constantine~
@7=~Hmmm Interesting say more~
@8=~recently a seer named Abdul Azir ( The insane ) was sent a vision of the future from God or Gods unknown, this prophecy foretold the destruction of the Gods, ALL the gods, at a time not long from now~
@9=~Is this vision to be trusted?~
@10=~Unfortunately Abdul Azir ( The insane ) has yet to be wrong in any of his predictions, the God or Gods that are his patrons seem to have knowledge of the future beyond that of Helm or even chronos himself~
@11=~Surely Helm would not let this pass!~
@12=~Helm has much to watch. Many are the threats that must be observed and countered, especially from the dark and chaotic powers in this imperfect universe. But even if he were to devote all his might to preventing this prophesy from coming to pass, it would be of no avail~
@13=~why? Helm is a mighty god is he not?~
@14=~Yes indeed, but the last part of Azirs prediction holds the sting, yes indeed, " The fate is sealed all the gods will pass at their own hand, yet I see one chance at redemption, a mortal with dark blood, raised in a candle, whose fire will burn through his worlds, you will find him in the Forgotten prime, on the world of farum, in the town of Athanka, where justice is made, at the date 15427.85385.978468.88 ( Multiverse time )"So as I said , your late ! its past 15427.85385.978472.00 already!~
@15=~so let me get this straight, you need me to save the universe?~
@16=~In a nutshell YES!~
@17=~And if I were to agree what would be expected of me?~
@18=~If you accept this solemn task you must gather information here in Anthanka to begin with, it is known that the twisted rune have vital information, they have a meeting spot nearby, in the bridge district, a door near the tanners shop is actually a portal, but be sure to have a Rouge Stone with you!.Alternatively seek answers in Hades some demons there can be squeezed for the truth.
Yet the final battle will be on the Astral plane, that is known by all, hence I have been instructed to give you the means of travel to the Astral plane and a letter from Helm himself~
@19=~Very well I accept~
@20=~You dare threaten a messenger of the gods!~
@21=~Errr since you put it that way NO!~
@22=~Damn right! die you impolite scum!~
@23=~Good, you have some wisdom, let us start again we have never met but your arrival here on this very spot has been foretold so I am here with a message ; Oh but where are my manners My name is Constantine~
@24=~Attack me if you dare, but know you bend to the will of Helm despite this action~
@25=~My name is unimportant, what do you want ?~
@26=~I said it?s about time you arrived, hard of hearing ?~
@27=~You insolent pig!~
@28=~That?s what I thought you said, care to venture an explanation?~
@29=~Happy to! we have never met but your arrival here on this very spot has been foretold so I am here with a message ; Oh but where are my manners My name is Constantine~
@30=~No sorry I am busy with personal business the universe will have to save itself~
@31=~It is a pity you feel that way, but my duty is fulfilled your fate lies before you, look to the astral plane for all our sakes, I now take my leave, fare well child of Bhall~
@32=~Good here are the ring and letter my duty is now fulfilled your fate lies before you, look to the astral plane for all our sakes, I now take my leave, fare well child of Bhall~
@33=~SAVE THE UNIVERSE
You have been given a letter from helm, a quest to stop LoLth from quite literally destroying all gods. Quite a quest! You have been instructed to find your way to the heart of the twisted rune either by finding their meeting place in the bridge district ( near the tanners house ) or taking a wander in Hades !~
@34=~So is this it? Is this the best Helm can muster? A puny demi mortal and his insignificant minions? Cringe in fear mortal for you now face LoLth~
@35=~You do not scare me spider queen, I have killed your servants, as all have died before me, and now your Avatar will follow quickly!~
@36=~Oh SHIT! ok I?m running~
@37=~Yes run mortal, I enjoy a hunt.~
@38=~Very well face the might of LoLth Orcus and Balrog, but know even if you succeed in defeating these Avatars, succeed in ruining work that has taken centuries to accomplish, you will never be safe from us, we will always be watching and plotting your downfall~
@39=~Yes run mortal, I enjoy a hunt. but know even if you succeed in eluding these Avatars, you will never be safe from us, we will always be the hunters, and you the meek prey!~
@40=~HA! More fools after the map, I shall enjoy feasting on your bones mortal!.~
@41=~Well done child of ball, as a reward you may keep what you find here, except for the Eye and Hand leave them here or face the displeasure of Helm.~
@42=~As the spell nears its zenith you must select which tuning fork to sound~
@43=~A..........Astral Plane.~
@44=~F..........Mechanus(Gladsheim).~
@45=~F(sharp)...Arcadia.~
@46=~F(flat)....Mount Celestia.~
@47=~E..........Bytopia(Nirvana).~
@48=~E(sharp)...Elysium.~
@49=~G..........Beastlands(Happy HUnting Grounds).~
@50=~G(sharp)...Olympus.~
@51=~G(flat)....Asgard.~
@52=~More options.~
@53=~Forget it..Cancel the spell.~
@54=~B(flat)....The Abyss.~
@55=~D(flat)....Carceri(Nine Hells).~
@56=~C(flat)....Gray Waste(Tarturus).~
@57=~A(flat)....Gehenna.~
@58=~D..........Baator(Hades).~
@59=~C..........Acheron.~
@60=~C(sharp)...The Outlands.~
@61=~E(flat)....Limbo.~
@62=~B..........Pandemonium~
@63=~Return to previous options~
@64=~You cannot Planeshift from this location.~
@65=~Something is blocking your attempt to Planeshift from this location.~
@66=~This Astral map spell transports you to a secret location, Lolths lab complex, within a hidden pocket plane, somewhere in the astral. Do you really want to go there ?~
@67=~Yes let the mayhem begin~
@68=~No~
@69=~This spell must be cast from the astral plane or any pocket planes located therein, you are not in an astral area so the spell fails and is wasted~
@70=~Although in an astral area something is blocking your transport, the spell fails and is wasted~
@71=~This Recall will take you to the Twisted Rune Headquarters far beneath Anthanka, Do you really want to go there ?~
@72=~Hello~
@73=~Who are you ?~
@74=~What are you doing here ?~
@75=~Are you another member of the twisted rune ?~
@76=~I am Android Zero~
@77=~I am being held captive here, the force shield you see prevents any movement even by me.~
@78=~No I am an experiment. I was created by my father the spirit of Dr Hastur, under the patronage of a being calling itself Lolth~
@79=~Why are you being held captive ?~
@80=~I am the first of three experiments, the final stage of which will be the creation of an unstoppable killing machine, nothing like the heights of Android 17 and 18, but the knowledge that created them has been lost even by my father~
@81=~Then you turned on your creators no doubt~
@82=~Get to the point creature~
@83=~On the contrary~
@84=~as the first of my line I am obviously full of bugs , the most serious of which affected the functioning of my mind, I was "born" with what you squashy creatures call compassion, a most fatal flaw in a killing machine.~
@85=~Is there any way to free you~
@86=~A most "interesting story" but I have people to kill and very little time, farewell.~
@87=~Maybe, maybe not, I have not been programmed with any knowledge of the technology that binds me, I believe you call it "magic"~
@88=~We have skill in magic maybe there is a scroll or incantation that can free you, we will look about in this complex, is there any information that you can give that would be of help ?~
@89=~None that would help free me~
@90=~Very well farewell until we find a means extricate you.~
@91=~Is there anything else you can tell us?~
@92=~Yes Lolth is nearly at stage 3, her lab complex is located somewhere on the Astral plane, on a pocket plane created by Anubis, if you intend to face the Bitch queen you will need all three pieces of the key wardsto.......URRRRRRKKKKKRRRRR...( goes quiet ) ~
@93=~Very well I will get back to my contemplations~
@94=~Strangers ! Good have waited a centaury guarding this dump, and not tasted man flesh for sooooo long~
@95=~So we meet again not in my wildest dreams did I believe you had the courage to seek out the heart of the twisted rune in Anthanka~
@96=~Fool !!! Have you never heard of the resurrection spell~
@97=~Enough of this ! I assure you this time the outcome will be different, and so to battle worm! Come defenders of the rune fulfill your pact and protect your master~
@98=~What Strangers ?! I have no idea how you got here but your curiosity will be your undoing, you have stumbled over powers you cannot comprehend, time to die worms~
@99=~Come defenders of the rune fulfill your pact and protect your master~
@100=~I have more than enough courage when hunting down evil as great as yours Lich~
@101=~Did I not just Kick your ass ?~
@102=~Errr I need to be going, dragons to slay and all that....~
@103=~Yes but how did you find a cleric dumb enough to resurrect a piece of slime like you ?~
@104=~"and the twisted rune must not let that bitch rule our actions and furthermore.." Ho brothers we have strangers in our midst, now what would a puny godchild and even more insignificant friends be doing taking a wander in Hades ?~
@105=~I have come to end your days thing of evil !~
@106=~Does everyone know of me and my business !~
@107=~I think you know why I am here~
@108=~I was taking a wander through the planes thought this would be a fine place for tea~
@109=~Oh not another do gooder !, very well then to battle, your father would have been so disappointed.~
@110=~Not everyone, but I am not everyone~
@111=~Damn your snide suggestions daemon tell me what you know of the twisted rune and I might spare you this time !~
@112=~I don?t take kindly to threats fool, to battle brothers~
@113=~Very wise godchild, maybe you are the one to take your fathers throne one day, we will not fight today, take this trinket it is worthless to me now but its magic will bring you the answers you seek , or your swift death. Now I bid you goodbye till next time we meet. Come brothers let us find a quieter place to talk~
@114=~Well tea you shall have..... COVERED IN BLOOD BAFOON !!!~
@115=~Fools! you may have seen through this little ruse but you will NOT take the key~
@116=~I know not where you have spung from nor how you penetrated the bitch queens defences to arrive at this secret location, but leave immeadiatly! Your very presence could interupt our concentration and free the horror we have trapped in yonder prison ~
@117=~Leave go! Flee now least this very conversation intrupts my concentration!~
@118=~Please i beg of you leave now!........... oh i cant stand these theatrics anymore, i told that dryder this was a rubbish idea, ok boys lets do this the old fashioned way, time to die whoever you are maggots~
@119=~Strangers! How bizzare, Well i must assume you are here with my patrons blessing so feel free to look round; i myself am searching for some reference material, do not mind me~
@120=~What manner of creature are you that you wander freely here in this place of evil~
@121=~Yes we are important emmisarries from a far land we to are looking for books~
@122=~Well dont mind if i do! I am sure there is some interesting stuff on these shelves~
@123=~Not so bizzare at all, well met stranger, what kind of material are you looking for ? A cloak , gloves ?~
@124=~Hastur ?~
@125=~I am of no importance, and from your manner of speaking im sure you are of no importance so i bid you good day sir ! ~
@126=~I doubt it! Your most proberbly thieves or spies, either way i think the plentifull guards here and in other rooms will soon see to your needs.~
@127=~You obviously have little brain, and i have no time for creatures such as you~
@128=~Yes, do i know you?~
@129=~No but let me introduce myself my name is <CHARNAME> pleased to meet you~
@130=~Well you are indeed a polite individual~
@131=~I am to the genius that created 13 and 14~
@132=~Thank you ! They were indeed the pinical of my work~
@133=~And how do you feel about android 1?~
@134=~That piece of junk my patron Lolth had me design ? I would have to say a definate departure from my normal work~
@135=~Oh really how so?~
@136=~Well given the history of 13 and 14 Lolth desired a more controllable and less "willfull" model line, she demanded less aggressive AI. This innevitably led to the useless 0 model, then she demanded minimal AI ! the result of which was model 1. it packs some punch on the battlefield but is easely defeated ~
@137=~Sounds like it has a flaw ?~
@138=~Indeed many~
@139=~So you are thieves or spies, either way i think the plentifull guards here and in other rooms will soon see to your needs.~
@140=~Would you care to elaborate on that~
@141=~Well for a start model 1 is quite vunrable to energy weapons, and because of its low AI vunrable to psionic discharges~
@142=~Greetings <CHARNAME> , Although always a pleasure, i am afraid you are a touch early. You see we are not fated to meet in earnest untill you have completed some more of your adventures in this land, please go about your buisness untill some time has passed and you are a touch more, how can i put this, experienced.~
@143=~Sorry still to early please return later~
@144=~Good you have returned and much more experienced i sense, fine let us get down to buisness~
@145=~We have never met , a name is usuall in such cases~
@146=~~
@147=~~
@148=~~
@149=~~
