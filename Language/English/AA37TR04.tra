@0=~This strange box seems formed from the same semi-liqid metal that makes up the rest of this area, a indented handprint seems the only controll. you could put your hand in the indentation if you wished~
@1=~As your hand rests on the cold surface of the container you feel suddenly stronger, but a flash occurs and creatures are summoned and some items appear ontop of the metal box.~
@2=~Some powerfull psionic force is holding the items in place. You may not remove them until the guardians are dead.~
@3=~The holding force is gone, you place the treasure in your pack~
@4=~The box seems to be of no further intrest.~
@5=~You are too far away to use that~
