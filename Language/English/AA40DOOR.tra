@0=~You feel very uneasy as you approach the sarcophagus. This is obviously the resting place of a powerefull member of the twisted rune. The lid looks heavy but you could remove it if you wish to~
@1=~You push the heavy lid aside and the foul stench of rot nearly over comes. There is some treasure, and a stone jar with a golden stopper. Power surges and creatures appear.~
@2=~Some powerfull psionic force is holding the items in place. You may not remove them until the guardians are dead.~
@3=~The holding force is gone, you place the treasure and key in your pack, the jar though you feel it wise to leave or destroy~
@4=~You strike the jar a mighty blow, you hear a sound very few have heard before, the sound of a Black soal sreaming as it is dragged to hell where it belongs. That is one less lich to plauge the waking world.~
@5=~The sarcophagus is now empty.~
@6=~You are too far away to use that~
