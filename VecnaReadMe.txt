SPOILER ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

The Vecna Campaign starts at the end of TOB, FINSOL04 gives the last child (children) of Bhall their final choice.
A... Become a god
B... Become a mortal

The Vecna Campaign provides a third choice and an explanation of the first two
A... Become a god........ Which really means become a puppet of Ao, and exist for as long as Ao wills
B... Become a mortal..... Die really quick as Cyrick takes swift action to end your miserable mortal life
C... Do a deal .......... Ao gives you a deal, ( which obviously is not much of a deal given the other choices) , travel to the planes and beyond on an errand for him, in return he will give you safe passage throughout Forgotten realms

The events of Die Vecna Die exposed the 5 who created the multiverse.
After the Chaos in Sigil caused by Vecna's arrival, possesion of the Godsmens's guild house, and subsiquent removal by a party of lucky amateures from Oerth.
It was the lady of pain who spoke words from the first tounge and reformed the multiverse to what we see now.

The Lady of pain AKA Pheonix AKA Fire Bird One..... Creator number 1

But let us not forget who put vecna up to all this cosmic mischief, the one who taught Vecna portions of the first tounge, the one who helped Vecna bend the very fabric of reality and escape the shadow realm.

The Serpent AKA Lord Ballor AKA Pallol One Eye..... Creator number 2

The lucky bunch of rank amatures that evicted Vecna from Sigil did so because they held an item that somehow negated part of his power, ( the hand ) what they did not notice is that that same item negated part of the 
lady of pain's power, and the eye that Vecna posessed was the very thing allowing him to stay in Sigil and resist the lady.
The hand and eye ( incorrectly called the hand and eye of Vecna, since he was just the latest of a long line of owners ) belong to 

Rhin AKA Android 13 AKA End of Law...... Creator number 3

Qwill AKA Android 12 AKA End of Chaos...... Creator number 4
